# dave.py

Dave.py is a discord bot made for my server but I have decided to share it to you. With dave you can have him as a server management bot.

# Setup

To get started clone and download the file and then open Dave.py with your text editor such as Visual Studio Code, Notepad (++), Atom. I suggest you use Visual studio code as it makes it easier for you to enter code.

# Requirements

You must have Python installed prior to downloading these files. You also need python PIP. To get pip do: **pip install discord**
**(If that doesn't work, do python -m pip install)**

# Running the bot

When complete run the bot by either double clicking the python file or opening cmd in the folder where the bot is saved and typing **python dave.py**. That should then run the bot.

# Support
